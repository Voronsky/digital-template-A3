<h2>Just Let it go</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
  A game about holding grudges
</li>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
  I want the player to experience that "lowering" the grudge bar will in turn make the player move throughout the world better and if not beautiful. I want the players to think about the concept of grudges and how it can affect oneself, but using the main character as a proxy.
</li>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
  Side scroller
</li>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
  The game "Just let it go" has basic side scrolling mechanics, where one can move and jump on various platforms. The unique features of the game is the concept of "grudge", players are to collect flowers which represent "letting go" aspects of the player's grudge, thus allowing the player to move faster throughout the world. The player cannot ultimately win unless their "grudge" is completely removed and depleted. Meanwhile, the player must dodge rabbits that represent getting "hurt" thus deepening the grudge of the player.
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
  The game mechanic is world changing, tile maps and collisions.
</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
  The tile map and the grudge mechanic, along with the changing of the world based on the status of the player's grudge bar.
</li>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
  Stuck in a mental realm an image which reflects his deep sense of grudge in his life. The player must help dude get out of his own mental hell-hole by teaching him how to forgive until he has finally let go of grudges.
</li>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The player takes on the character "dude", self reflecting on his life, he is stuck in his own inner hell. This mental world that encompasses him is dark and gloomy, all judged by the grudge he has held within yet within this realm, he finds flowers; bits and pieces of relief or forgiveness that he must collect. As dude contains to collect these flowers he finds himself eventually letting go, yet dude cannot escape this realm unless he has fully let go of his grudges
</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
  Side scroller fans and those who wish to play games tackling real life concepts.
</li>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
  The game can take up to 5-10 minutes depending on how successful the player is manuevering throughout the map
</li>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
  The best strategies is to move around the world slowly and timing the jumps to collect. The less "hurt" the player is, the quicker it will be for the player to begin to move faster.
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
  Most of the assets were borrowed from Deviantart or sprite database. The artist of the background, inspired by the Limbo theme is saphireitrenore. The tiles come from opengameart.org
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
  The game in it's scenery and "theme" resembles that of Limbo, a game I found quite interesting and thought would be a useful concept to teach the issue of grudges. Also it incorporates the objectives of a practical game called "The angry rock", where the participants are told to do a 50-meter dash with one another holding a heavy rock, and by proxy learning that the rock, like grudges, make it harder to run or meet one's objective. Thus it would be much easier to let go of the rock or "grudge" so that one may move on faster.
