<h1><u>Just let it go</u></h1>

<p>The game is based on the concepts of holding grudges and learning to forgive. It is influenced by a practical game called "The Angry Rock", where players line up and race doing a 50-meter dash; all while holding a heavy rock. By proxy they would learn that by letting go of the rock, or grudge(s), they will move on faster. "Just Let it go" takes a similar approach, the player traverses through the mind of the main character in which is a world molded by his grudge. The objective is to collect the flowers that represent "letting go" bits of his immense grudge. Watch as how the grudge bar affects a player's mobility in this world.</br>
The game is also inspired by the theme of Limbo</p>
